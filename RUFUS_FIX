Don’t even complicate it by logs n stufff

Here is a simple solution which allows u to create a persistence partition as large as u want! 1 Tb 100 Tb ....n so on
Only the limitation is ur physical disk space not a software bug

Note-By viewing the scenario it is clear that there is definitely a problem with the formatting module of rufus.

Now here is a solution

Set the persistence partition to 1GB	Within a few minutes your file will be flashed on the usb .	Supposedly I want to create a 100 gb partition	I have a 128 gb usb	28 Gb a reserved for my iso boot sector, 1 gb as persistence and 99 gb unallocated memory	Now our goal is to merge the 99 gb to 1 gb persistence to make it 100 gb persistence which we could not have done otherwise on rufus as it would be stuck on 100% formatting
7.So either arrange a vm or casually boot another iso in an Minimum of 4gb stick. Note- don’t boot in the stick you have to operate on.

8.now install gparted (Linux partition manager for gnome btw) sometimes preinstalled just check and open it.

9.now at the top right u select your 128 gb stick.

Right click on the persistence 1gb sector and unmount it
9.then right click again on the same 1 gb persistence sector to resize and give it a size of 100gb by moving the start and ending black arrows

10.now click on the tick icon and apply the changes (located under the word help btw)

11.it will take some time and then show u that u have a boot partition of 28 gb and persistent partition of 100 gb exactly what u wanted !!

Took me 1 hour to add 50 gb.

Note just to confirm if everything went right, just boot up the usb after resizing and make sure that there is no persistence folder by default on the desktop
If there is a persistence folder then redo the process

In the above example u did not mess with the initial 28 go of boot file so don’t worry it is safe!

Thanks.
